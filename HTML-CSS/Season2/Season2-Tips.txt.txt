TIPS for CSS Intro :
 We have a concept in programming named "Seperation of concern". Concept that works seperate from other part of program, should be seperted.
 The priority of inline tags is higher than class so other styles will be override. 
 ID's are unique and used just for one element but classes are more general.

TIPS for Relational Selectors : 
 #products p => applies to all of the p tags even ones in child tags that inside the #products (#products p {}  remember to space between them).
 #products > p => applies to all of the p tags that are directly the child of #products in everywhere up or down, but doesn't apply to the inside
 tags. 
 #products + p => applies just to the first tag that comes right after the #products, and for all of them used #products ~ p .
 WE can also select the attributes of tags :  for example a [href*="fronthooks"].

TIPS for pseusdo class : 
These classes made by browser itself, made with #products :first-child syntax.
NOTICE we should use h2:hover without any space cause it is a tag not class or id.
We called all of  the a tags with href hyperlink that they have anchor.

TIPS for pseusdo element :
 These are not exist in our html file at all and we add them with css. 

 TIPS for selector specificity : 
 There is priority : id, class, tag . (1,0,1)
 NOTE there is difference form #idh2 and #id h2 the first one means AND of these two in one line. the second one means find the h2 
 tag with this id in a child.

 TIPS for inheritance : 
 Sometimes we don't need to apply the properties to some tags that are child of their father class and they inherite these prop.
 Tags related to fonts, colors, text has inherited. FOR AVOID THIS SET FOR EXAMPLE COLOR OF SPAN TAG TO : INITIAL OR SET ANOTHER
 THING.

TIPS for colors : 
RGB : red, green, blue from 0 to 255. amd a for alpha.
HSL : hue (circle from 0 to 360 degree) Saturation from 0 t0 100% and lightness from 0 to 100%
HEXA : 6 digits but 3 for simplifiy form if all of them are same like #fff.

TIPS for gradients :
You can specify the firection or degree in first position in gradient for example : (23deg, blue, pink 30%) or (top left ,...).

TIPS for borders :
Common tags are border, border-width, border-top an border-radius. we can make css shapes with these elements. 

TIPS for box shadows :
Used from this order to make a shadow in positive directions : right, bottom, blure and color.
TWO TYPES OF SHADOW : box-shadow and text-shadow.
