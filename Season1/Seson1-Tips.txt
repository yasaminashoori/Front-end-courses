TIPS for making a local server : 
127.0.0.1 Local address
On 55500 port
name of file /index.html


TIPS for Meta Tags : 
-We usually use from : Charset ,  viewport , description , keywords. 
-Used from viewport to show the user the screen size and initial zoom of it.


TIPS for Head Tags : 
 -Between b/i/em/strong as much as you can use form em and strong. others are outdated in HTML5
 -We have headings and concept named hierarchy. it means that we should respect to the sequence of headings and we can't have h4 before using any h3. 
 -Another TIP : every html page has only one H1 tag !


TIPS for HyperLink : 
-Types of HyperLinks : 1-Relative links (internal links such as files of the folders) 2-Absolute links (external links)
-We can move to a section of the page with links : id=name href=#name 

TIPS for Images : 
-With object-fit we control the size of image. contain fits iamge but empty space, but cover fills the bg. we often used from contain.


TIPS for Videos : 
-We can control over the videos with these prop : autoplay, loop and ... also we can display a text to the user if the video doesnt play.
and also we have audio tag that use as same as video tag.

TIPS for List : 
TIPS for Containers :  we have two types of elements  : 1-Block level 2-Inline level 
Block level tags filled the whole space of it's front. and the size of width has no effect. but inline filles as the size ot width.


TIPS for Semantic : 
When we want to use an absolutely independent tag we should use from artcile and aside like banners
every page has just one h2 tag 
the main structure of our site should be like : 
every page should have just one main tag for the important contents.
section are comletely relatvie together.
