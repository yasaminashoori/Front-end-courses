TIPS for box model : 
With the help of Margin we can make distance tas from each others and with padding make distance tag from it's border.
Browser takes 16 px padding always by default.
We have a situation that called margin collapsing, it happened when we have two margin around each other and we want to take them 
margin, but the bigger margin will be applied or one of them if they are equal.
When want to distence an element from toop, left, bottom or right give them margin but if we want to distance a content from it's 
border give them padding.

TIPS for box sizing : 
When we add padding and marign to the box with the specified width and height the size of the box will be changed because of the box-sizing's 
value sets on content-box and to remove this sets that to border-box.
And for the before and after too. but if we want to puth the boxes on one line and give them width and height : set the display to inline-block.

TIPS for measuring unit : 
We have two types of units : absolute and relative, the absolute examples are pt, px, ch, mm, cm and for the relative type are : %, vw, vh, rem, em.
% : based on size of parent container.
vw and vh : viewport height and width current or root
it will get height when the content is inside it.
