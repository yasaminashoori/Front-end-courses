TIPS for fonts : 
Give the font-family style to the body instead of p, h2 and other tags.
We used " " for fonts that have space and long name "Time Since" and also always used a dafault font for the times that given font doesn't work.
font-weight : bold or light
font formats : ttf, eot, woff, woff2 (woff and woff2 suggested).


TIPS for font size : 
It's recommended to use just ine font in the program.
responsive fonts and always use rem.
line height : should be 1.5 times more that font-size BUT WE USED 1.5 AND IT AUTOMATICALLY CALCULATED (WITHOUT USING 1.5 REM).
text-align : right or left (NEVER USED JUSTIFY BAD FOR UX)
p + p {
  text-indent: 2rem;   /*it means first doesn't give and the second gives indent */
  /* paragraphayi ke bad tag paragaph oomadan */
}


/* 18px = > 18 /  16 = 1.4  */
/* "" those have strings have  space between. if the fontns were availabe we shouls show something else to the user */
/* ttf eot (the best => woof woff2)*/
/* we can put this @fontface in a seperate file named as font.css */
/* responsive , px or rem ? rem! for updating to th changed in font of browser */

/* rem better px not good for apple with high resolation */
